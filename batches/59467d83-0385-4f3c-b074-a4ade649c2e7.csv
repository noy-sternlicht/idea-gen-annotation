"Existing methods for open-vocabulary querying often rely on a manually set fixed empirical threshold to select regions based on their semantic feature distance to the query text embedding, which can lead to challenges in accurately identifying specific target areas. This traditional approach frequently lacks universal accuracy, highlighting the need for a more precise method of feature selection that can improve the localization of pertinent 3D regions.",the feature selection process,inspiration,"Background: Existing methods for open-vocabulary querying often rely on a manually set fixed empirical threshold to select regions based on their semantic feature distance to the query text embedding, which can lead to challenges in accurately identifying specific target areas.
