"The event camera fails to capture object edges that are parallel to the camera motion, which is a problem intrinsic to the sensor and challenging to solve algorithmically. Human vision employs small involuntary eye movements, known as microsaccades, to deal with perceptual fading and maintain texture stability, highlighting a gap in existing event camera technology that this research aims to address.",event cameras,inspiration,"Background: The event camera fails to capture object edges that are parallel to the camera motion, which is a problem intrinsic to the sensor and challenging to solve algorithmically.
