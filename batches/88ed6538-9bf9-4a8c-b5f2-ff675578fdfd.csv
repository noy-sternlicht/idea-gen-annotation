"The increasing demand for dynamic 3D assets in design and gaming applications has highlighted the limitations of previous methods, which often result in defects such as over-saturation and the Janus problem. Additionally, practical challenges like dramatic temporal inconsistency, inter-frame geometry and texture diversity, and semantic defects in video generation results necessitate the development of more effective solutions.",optimize a 4D representation by explicitly generating multi-view videos from one input image,inspiration,"Background: The increasing demand for dynamic 3D assets in design and gaming applications has highlighted the limitations of previous methods, which often result in defects such as over-saturation and the Janus problem.

"Unsupervised domain adaptation for monocular depth estimation has been explored to reduce reliance on large annotated datasets, but this often requires training multiple models or complex protocols. The need for a simpler and more effective approach that can operate with only source domain ground truth labels is evident, as demonstrated by the challenges faced in prior work.",unsupervised domain adaptation for monocular depth estimation,inspiration,"Background: Unsupervised domain adaptation for monocular depth estimation has been explored to reduce reliance on large annotated datasets, but this often requires training multiple models or complex protocols.
