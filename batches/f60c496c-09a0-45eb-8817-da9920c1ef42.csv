"Previous approaches to structured reasoning using large language models suffer from error propagation due to their autoregressive nature and single-pass decoding, which lack error correction capabilities. Additionally, relying on a single sample can lead to the omission of true nodes and edges in the reasoning graph.",conducting structured reasoning,inspiration,"Background: Previous approaches to structured reasoning using large language models suffer from error propagation due to their autoregressive nature and single-pass decoding, which lack error correction capabilities.

"During crises, the overwhelming volume of conversations on social media can escalate to unprecedented levels, creating a need for automated systems to effectively identify and match requests and offers. Additionally, there is a notable absence of studies conducted in multi-lingual settings, despite the diverse linguistic populations that may exist in any geographical area during emergencies.",the automated identification and matching of requests and offers on social media platforms during emergencies,inspiration,"Background: During crises, the overwhelming volume of conversations on social media can escalate to unprecedented levels, creating a need for automated systems to effectively identify and match requests and offers.
