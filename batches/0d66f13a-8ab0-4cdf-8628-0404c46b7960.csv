"The lack of widely acknowledged testing mechanisms for evaluating large language models (LLMs) has led to uncertainty regarding their comprehension capabilities, particularly in understanding nuanced semantics. Existing research primarily focuses on surface-level natural language understanding, neglecting the fine-grained explorations necessary for a deeper understanding of LLMs' unique comprehension mechanisms and their alignment with human cognition.",Large language models,inspiration,"Background: The lack of widely acknowledged testing mechanisms for evaluating large language models (LLMs) has led to uncertainty regarding their comprehension capabilities, particularly in understanding nuanced semantics.
