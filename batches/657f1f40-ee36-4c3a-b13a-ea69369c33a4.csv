The challenge of selectively retaining memories of permanent elements while managing the frequent changes of ephemeral objects in robotic perception necessitates a method that can effectively decompose environments from transient elements. This need for robust environmental mapping and object segmentation in a self-supervised manner highlights a gap in existing approaches that often require human intervention or struggle with consistency across multiple traversals.,multitraverse environmental mapping,inspiration,"Background: The challenge of selectively retaining memories of permanent elements while managing the frequent changes of ephemeral objects in robotic perception necessitates a method that can effectively decompose environments from transient elements.

"Understanding how neural networks select between multiple algorithms during training is a significant challenge, particularly in the context of resource constraints that influence which solutions prevail. Additionally, there is a need to explore the dynamics of representations within neural networks to gain insights into their training processes and the interactions between different solutions.","a neural network at initialization contains many solutions (representations and algorithms), which compete with each other under pressure from resource constraints, with the ""fittest"" ultimately prevailing",inspiration,"Background: Understanding how neural networks select between multiple algorithms during training is a significant challenge, particularly in the context of resource constraints that influence which solutions prevail.
