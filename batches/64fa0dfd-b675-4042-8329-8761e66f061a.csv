"The integration of large language models (LLMs) into knowledge-based question answering (KBQA) presents challenges due to their high costs and lack of domain-specific knowledge during pre-training. Additionally, optimizing for both accuracy and cost in model selection is complex, as different models excel in various knowledge areas, making it laborious to determine the best fit for specific tasks.",Knowledge-based question answering,inspiration,"Background: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into knowledge-based question answering (KBQA) presents challenges due to their high costs and lack of domain-specific knowledge during pre-training.

"Large Language Models (LLMs) face challenges due to their overreliance on potentially flawed parametric knowledge, leading to hallucinations and inaccuracies, especially with long-tail, domain-specific queries. Additionally, the presence of noisy and irrelevant information in retrieved long-context documents can dilute LLMs' attention, highlighting the need for improved methods to enhance their contextual awareness and robustness.",improve the robustness and contextual awareness of Large Language Models,inspiration,"Background: Large Language Models (LLMs) face challenges due to their overreliance on potentially flawed parametric knowledge, leading to hallucinations and inaccuracies, especially with long-tail, domain-specific queries.

"The quantification of emergence in large language models (LLMs) has proven challenging due to the lack of a measurable definition and the difficulties in interpreting statistical estimations based on model performances. Existing methods consume significant resources and may not accurately reflect the models' intrinsic emergence, highlighting a need for a more effective and interpretable approach to estimate emergence.","the ""intelligent"" behaviors of LLMs",inspiration,"Background: The quantification of emergence in large language models (LLMs) has proven challenging due to the lack of a measurable definition and the difficulties in interpreting statistical estimations based on model performances.
