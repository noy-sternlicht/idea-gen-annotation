"The current approach to processing event data often converts it into frame-based representations, which neglects the sparsity of event data and loses fine-grained temporal information, leading to an increased computational burden and making it ineffective for characterizing event camera properties. Additionally, there exists a performance gap between point-based methods and frame-based methods, indicating a need for improved techniques that can effectively leverage the unique characteristics of event cameras.",Event cameras,inspiration,"Background: The current approach to processing event data often converts it into frame-based representations, which neglects the sparsity of event data and loses fine-grained temporal information, leading to an increased computational burden and making it ineffective for characterizing event camera properties.
