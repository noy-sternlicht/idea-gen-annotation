"The rapid growth of neural network models has resulted in model weights becoming an important yet underutilized data modality, primarily due to their uninterpretable nature and the disorganized state of publicly available models. There is a need to decode the underlying relationships between models, as this information is crucial for applications such as model authorship attribution and could lead to more organized indexing of neural networks.",the origin of models,inspiration,"Background: The rapid growth of neural network models has resulted in model weights becoming an important yet underutilized data modality, primarily due to their uninterpretable nature and the disorganized state of publicly available models.
