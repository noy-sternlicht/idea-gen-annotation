"The increasing demand for dynamic 3D assets in design and gaming applications has highlighted the limitations of previous methods, which often result in defects such as over-saturation and the Janus problem. Additionally, practical challenges like dramatic temporal inconsistency, inter-frame geometry and texture diversity, and semantic defects in video generation results necessitate the development of more effective solutions.",optimize a 4D representation by explicitly generating multi-view videos from one input image,inspiration,"Background: The increasing demand for dynamic 3D assets in design and gaming applications has highlighted the limitations of previous methods, which often result in defects such as over-saturation and the Janus problem.
