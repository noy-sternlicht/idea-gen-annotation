"Traditional belief revision frameworks often fail to account for human cognitive patterns, as they rely on formal principles that may not reflect actual human reasoning. This gap highlights the need for a framework that aligns belief revision dynamics with the explanatory understanding that people seek when resolving inconsistencies.",Traditional belief revision frameworks,inspiration,"Background: Traditional belief revision frameworks often fail to account for human cognitive patterns, as they rely on formal principles that may not reflect actual human reasoning.
