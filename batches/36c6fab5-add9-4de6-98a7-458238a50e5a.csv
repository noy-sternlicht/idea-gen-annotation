"The study identifies deficiencies in reference-free metrics used for evaluating the compatibility between textual descriptions and images, highlighting issues such as incoherent statements and excessive repetition in generated descriptions. This indicates a need for improved evaluation methods that can better align with human judgment and rectify the shortcomings of existing metrics.",Evaluating the compatibility between textual descriptions and corresponding images,inspiration,"Background: The study identifies deficiencies in reference-free metrics used for evaluating the compatibility between textual descriptions and images, highlighting issues such as incoherent statements and excessive repetition in generated descriptions.

"To enhance zero-shot translation, models need to share knowledge across languages, which is a challenge in many-to-many multilingual neural machine translation. Existing methods may not effectively leverage both semantic and linguistic features, limiting their ability to improve translation performance across diverse languages.",the many-to-many multilingual neural machine translation,inspiration,"Background: To enhance zero-shot translation, models need to share knowledge across languages, which is a challenge in many-to-many multilingual neural machine translation.

Additionally, while large language models have strong capabilities, they suffer from uncontrollable outputs, leading to mediocre performance in this task.",Emotion-Cause Pair Extraction,inspiration,"Background: Existing methods for Emotion-Cause Pair Extraction tend to overfit spurious correlations, such as positional bias in benchmark datasets, rather than effectively capturing semantic features.
