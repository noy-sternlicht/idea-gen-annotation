"The research addresses the challenge of enabling modular robots to self-organize and maintain specific morphologies and functions through simple interactions, which is essential for their effective operation in various applications. Additionally, it highlights the need for algorithms that can facilitate the aggregation and movement of these robots while preserving their collective shape and functionality.",Swarm robots,inspiration,"Background: The research addresses the challenge of enabling modular robots to self-organize and maintain specific morphologies and functions through simple interactions, which is essential for their effective operation in various applications.

"Traditional belief revision frameworks often fail to account for human cognitive patterns, as they rely on formal principles that may not reflect actual human reasoning. This gap highlights the need for a framework that aligns belief revision dynamics with the explanatory understanding that people seek when resolving inconsistencies.",Traditional belief revision frameworks,inspiration,"Background: Traditional belief revision frameworks often fail to account for human cognitive patterns, as they rely on formal principles that may not reflect actual human reasoning.
