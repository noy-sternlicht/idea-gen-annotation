"The significant amount of training experience necessary to learn effective policies in Deep Reinforcement Learning remains a primary concern, both in simulated and real environments. Additionally, existing methods often require a supervisory agent mask, which limits their applicability and efficiency in learning from fewer trials, similar to human skill acquisition.",Deep Reinforcement Learning,inspiration,"Background: The significant amount of training experience necessary to learn effective policies in Deep Reinforcement Learning remains a primary concern, both in simulated and real environments.
